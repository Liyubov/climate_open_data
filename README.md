# Climate open data
This is folder for downloaded open data for analysis and some tests for other open software for time-series analysis.
We use several sources for open data on e.g. temperature
https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ from GES DISC MERRA (reanalysis data)

Main variables are: 

    surface_air_temperature 

    surface_layer_height 

    surface_pressure 

    surface_specific_humidity 

    surface_wind_speed
